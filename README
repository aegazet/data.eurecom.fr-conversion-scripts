This is the code developed during my semester project at EURECOM, 
"Building data.eurecom.fr".

chain.sh will execute the python scripts in order. This will generate 
RDF files in the working directory and load them in a triplestore. This 
will also create some pickle files. In the end, a JSON file is created 
for use in Exhibit. 

Requirements:
- get dependencies : rdflib (& isodate), SPARQLWrapper, httplib2
- execute the code from withing EURECOM's network
- change the address of the repository in 3_update.py and 
4_makeJSONExhibit.py
